#Description

My partner and I were working on a project for the one we are sponsoring, which is the Nubian Goat Farm, "Lil Patch of Heaven." The sponsor already had a website to begin with. We were asking if we should change it or make it look like the one they had now. They wanted it to look the same but add a little more touches to it. The "For Sale" page is the newest page we added because of the requests of the sponsor.

#Usage

The usage of the website is to sell nubian goats in Tennessee. It is also to get the farm noticed by the community to help sell the goats to make some profit but mostly for the enjoyment of the owner of Lil Patch of Heaven. It is to help what kind of goats they can breed and shows the infomation to the user about the goats as much as they can give.

#Support
