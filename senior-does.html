Jaala is our Herd Queen. She was our first doe we purchased back in May of 2015.  She will be a 4th freshener in 2020. She is 7/8 Nubian and 1/8 Oberhasli but only registered as a 50% grade with the ADGA due to her dam being unregistered. Her attachment is not ideal but it doesn't stop her from putting milk in the bucket.  She is an excellent milker for any homestead and produces well over a gallon a day during her lactation. We have improved her lines for better udder attachment which you can see with her 2018 doeling Lil Patch Of Heaven Misbehaven who was a FF (first freshener) this year. </p></b>
