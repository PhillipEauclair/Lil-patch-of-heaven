Ridley was born on the farm in March of 2018. After some debating whether to sell or retain him, we decided to retain him and breed him to our herd queen Jaala in the fall of 2018 and he did not disappoint. He gave us two doelings in March of 2019. He has grown into an impressive yearling buck and is already as tall as his sire Jagger and we are very excited to watch Ridley grow this year. He will be bred to Jaala and Felicite this fall breeding season!</p>

Please help us welcome our very exciting new addition, Naiche! 

(Pronounced Nah-ee-chay) 

We purchased him from Barb Halazon in September of 2019, and we are very excited to add his genetics to our herd. We have admired Barb's herd for awhile now and we knew we wanted to purchase from her someday, and someday finally came. We are very grateful that she offered us this handsome boy, and we don't think he will disappoint. We plan to use him heavily in our breeding program this fall. </p>

We had Jagger for 3 years. He was purchased in January of 2016.  We bottle raised him from 3 weeks old. He was a great buck and very well mannered and low maintenance. He produced 5 doelings and 3 bucklings while he was with us. He was sold in May 2019.</p>

We had Merlin for a little over a year. He was purchased in May of 2018.  Merlin was a sweet buck and pretty well mannered. He produced 2 doelings while he was with us. It is with great sadness that we decided to no longer use him in our herd breeding program due to health concerns. He was sold in September of 2019 to a pet only home.</p>
